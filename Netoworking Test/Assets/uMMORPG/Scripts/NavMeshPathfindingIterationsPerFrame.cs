// Unity only calculates 'n' navmesh pathfinding iterations per frame. The
// default value of 100 is fine for small projects, but an MMO with huge amounts
// of agents will require more iterations per frame to avoid movement delays.
//
// For now we simply increase that number in Awake once.
// In the future we will be able to set the iteration number per agent:
//   https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/pathfindingiterationsperframe-for-bigger-games-should-be-per-agent.482699/
//
// Note: we could already use Update to set iterations to players.count*multiplier,
// but it's not that much better since one player could still delay all other
// player's path calculations.
